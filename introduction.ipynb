RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:A recommendation system is any system that automatically suggests content, products or serivces which should interest customers based on their preferences.
PURPOSE:
The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.

1.Content-based recommendation engine
2.Collobrative-filtering (CF) based recommendation engine 
3.Popularity based recommendation systems
4.Classification model based
5.Hybrid Approaches
6.Association rule mining
